### Project Description
An intelligent phishing URL detection system that combines Machine Learning, Rule-Based Analysis, Blacklist Verification, and Community Reporting to identify malicious websites in real time.


### The Problem statement
This project detects phishing websites by checking the URL using machine learning and basic security rules. It verifies domain details, SSL security, and user reports to decide if a site is safe or not. The goal is to protect users from fake and harmful websites in a simple and fast way.

### The Solution
We built a hybrid phishing detection system that checks whether a website is safe or fake before allowing the user to proceed.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used:  JavaScript, Python, CSS,html,JSON
- Frameworks used: Flask
- Libraries used:pandas,scikit-learn,numpy,flask,joblib
- Tools used: Vscode,JupyterNotebook,Chrome Extension

## Features
1.Feature Extraction – The system analyzes the URL structure (length, special characters, suspicious words, etc.).

2.Machine Learning Model – A trained Random Forest model predicts whether the URL looks like phishing or legitimate.

3.Domain Age Check – It verifies how old the domain is (new domains are more suspicious).

4.SSL Certificate Check – It checks if the website has a valid HTTPS security certificate.

5.Blacklist Check – It compares the URL with stored phishing links.

6.Risk Score Calculation – All results are combined to generate a final threat level.

7.User Warning Page – If risky, a warning page is shown with reasons and report count.

## Implementation

```bash
pip install flask
